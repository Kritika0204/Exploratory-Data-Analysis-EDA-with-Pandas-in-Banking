# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-with-Pandas-in-Banking
The purpose of this project is to master the exploratory data analysis (EDA) in banking with Pandas framework.

Goals of the Project:
Explore a banking dataset with Pandas framework. Build pivot tables. Visualize the dataset with various plot types.
Importing the libraries necessary for this project. We can add some aliases to make the libraries easier to use in our code and set a default figure size for further plots.
